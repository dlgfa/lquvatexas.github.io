 I work in **bayesian statistics**, **machine learning**, **time series** and **high dimensional statistics**. 
 The applications of my research include integrative analysis in genomics omics data, cancer research, and clinical trial.

My career goal is to develop interpretable large scale statistical learning methods to advance the science of technology and human diseases.

I believe robust statistical learning methods are necessary and important to handle the data heteroscedasticity. 

As a result, I focus on jointly analyzing different sources of time series data (for example, transcripts, proteins, metabolomics, clinical test, neuroimages, human motion capture,etc) and examining the dynamic relationship among these data
, particularly, studying the latent embeddings of the complex multimodal time series data through deep neural network and bayesian priors, it leads to more powerful and interpertable understanding the hidden truth. 
By examining further different subgroups helps give us a more comprehensive view of the entire population.
