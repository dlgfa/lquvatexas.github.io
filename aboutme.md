My name is Lin Qiu, a 4th year Biostatistics Ph.D. student at Penn State University, advised by [Dr. Vernon M. Chinchilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Chinchilli) and [Dr. Lin Lin](http://www.personal.psu.edu/lul37/). 
 **Ph.D. thesis topic**: Probabilistic statistical learning methods for high-dimensional multivariate data. I was a research intern at [AbbVie SDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbbVie) (Boston office) working with [Dr. Jie Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jie-cheng-97165119/) on subgroup identification for precision medicine during summer 2019.

I hold an M.Sc. in Statistics from the University of Texas at Austin, advised by 
[Dr.Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/). **M.S. report topic**: Methods of Genotype Imputation for Genome-wide Association Studies

Before that, I studied cell and molecular biology at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). I am from Sichuan, China.

I'm a marathon runner and music lover. 

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love and imagination. Therefore I would like to choose
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
