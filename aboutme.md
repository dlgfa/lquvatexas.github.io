title: About me
---

My name is Lin Qiu, the 4th year statistical machine learning PhD student at Penn State University, advised by [Dr.Vernon M. Chinchilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Chinchilli) and [Dr. Lin Lin](http://www.personal.psu.edu/lul37/). I was a research intern at AbbVie SDS (Boston office) working with [Dr. Jie Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jie-cheng-97165119/) during summer 2019. 

I hold an M.Sc. in Statistics from the University of Texas at Austin, advised by 
[Dr.Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/). Before that, I studied cell and molecular biology at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). I am from Sichuan, China.

I'm a marathon runner and music lover. 

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love and imagination. Therefore I would like to choose
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
